The fb Object
=============

This is a helper object generated by our facebook app. It stores some useful informations such as user info and permissions.
Feel free to add your own attributes.
By default it provides the following attributes if the user is logged in:

    * user
        * access_token: the user access token
        * base_domain: the domain set in the app settings. Facebook apps have a single domain policy.
        * expires: Unix timestamp of the access_token expiration date.
        * secret 
        * session_key
        * sig
        * uid: The current user's facebook id.
    
    * perms (subject to change)
        * Array of the extended permissions such as 'read_stream', 'email' and so on.
